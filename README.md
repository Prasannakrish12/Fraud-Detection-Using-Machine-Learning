[![Open In Colab]([https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([https://colab.research.google.com/github/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/blob/main/Fraud_Detection.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QAeftjrr_k_RbSRuyA_NL509_uCDtsiL?usp=sharing)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QAeftjrr_k_RbSRuyA_NL509_uCDtsiL?usp=sharing))

An end-to-end machine learning project for detecting fraudulent transactions using Python.  
Covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.  
Built for educational purposes using a publicly available dataset.

## Features
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Feature engineering and scaling
- Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Visualizations for better insights

## Files in this Repository
- **Fraud_Detection.ipynb** – Main Jupyter Notebook with the complete project code  
- **dataset.csv** – Sample dataset used for training and evaluation (public dataset)
